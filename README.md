# Data-Science
Portfolio of my data science projects

Some tools I have developed may seem inefficient. Some of this is due to me still learning/growing as a programmer and data scientist, some of them are due to these being developed for an environment that primarily uses excel. So instead querying data directly from a database, the program will work off of excel inputs for instance since this is the way I am given the data.

<h2>Projects</h2>
####PFAS Project:
- PFAS are a class of chemicals that are emerging contaminants of concern. This project attempts to create a centralized database of all publically available environmental PFAS data to create models predicting PFAS contamination in drinking water resources and industrial sites. This data will also be used to classify specific PFAS chemical fingerprint and analyze trends in PFAS contamination and regulation. 

#### ToxTools:
-  A series of tools I developed to automate tasks commonly performed in Toxicology/Risk Assessment consulting. These tools are designed to be used for others without needing knowledge of Python using Pyinstaller to create executable files. Inputs and outputs are typically using excel files which is the common data/presentation format for the industry.

#### Machine Learning (Kaggle)
- A-B Testing:

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (Kaggle)

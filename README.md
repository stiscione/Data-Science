# Portfolio

Portfolio of my data science projects completed and in-progress for professional, self-learning, and hobby purposes. Most are presented in the form of iPython notebooks. I am new to using github as a repository for my portfolio and I am continually migrating my projects/notebooks, so please check back to see new things I've worked on.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
Notebooks can be run using jupyter notebook.

<h3>Projects</h3>

#### [PFAS Project](https://github.com/stiscione/Portfolio/tree/main/PFAS-Project):
- PFAS are a class of chemicals that are emerging contaminants of concern. This project attempts to create a centralized database of all publically available environmental PFAS data to create models predicting PFAS contamination in drinking water resources and industrial sites. This data will also be used to classify specific PFAS chemical fingerprint and analyze trends in PFAS contamination and regulation. 

#### [ToxTools](https://github.com/stiscione/ToxTools):
-  A series of tools I developed to automate tasks commonly performed in Toxicology/Risk Assessment consulting. These tools are designed to be used for others without needing knowledge of Python using Pyinstaller to create executable files. Inputs and outputs are typically using excel files which is the common data/presentation format for the industry.

#### [Fantasy Football](https://github.com/stiscione/Portfolio/tree/main/Fantasy-Football):
- A project scraping all available National Football League data to create a centralized database and exploratory data analysis and development of predictive models to inform fantasy football decision making.

<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>

- [A-B Testing](https://github.com/stiscione/Portfolio/blob/main/A-B%20Testing%20Example.ipynb): Analysis of A-B testing data from a mobile game to improve player retention (Kaggle).

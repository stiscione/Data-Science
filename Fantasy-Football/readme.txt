Fantasy Football involves drafting a team of players in the National Football League to make your own team. Each week your team plays against another person's
team in your league. Each player on your team will score points based on their performance in the real world NFL game that takes place that week.
The team with the highest points wins for that week. This continues over several weeks culminating in an elimination bracket.

Fantasy sport, including fantasy football, is a multi-billion dollar industry, thus there is a financial incentive for predict future performance
of players in the NFL. Despite the attenation and efforts of analysts, fantasy football has extremely high variance, where the consensus best player always underperforms
and undrafted players break into the top 12 players of the season.

This folder contains examples of some the tools and programs I have written to find insights and key indicators of future performance in fantasy football.
